Step 1 - From the XAMPP Control Panel, under Apache, click the Config button, and select the Apache (httpd.conf).

Inside the httpd.conf file, somehow I found a line that says:

Listen 80
And change the 80 into any number / port you want. In my scenario I’m using port 8080.

Listen 8080
Still from the httpd.conf file, I found another line that says:

ServerName localhost:80

And change 80 to 8080.

ServerName localhost:8080
Step 2 - From the XAMPP Control Panel, under Apache, click the Config button again, but this time select the Apache (httpd-ssl.conf). Inside the httpd-ssl.conf file, find line that says

Listen 443
And change the 443 into any number / port you want. I’ll using 4433 as the new port number.

Listen 4433
Still from the httpd-ssl.conf file, find another line that says

<VirtualHost _default_:443>

ServerName localhost:443
And change 443 to 4433.

<VirtualHost _default_:4433>

ServerName localhost:4433
Remember to save the httpd.conf and httpd-ssl.conf files after performing some changes. Then restart the Apache service.
